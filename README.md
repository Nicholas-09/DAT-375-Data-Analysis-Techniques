# DAT-375-Data-Analysis-Techniques
# Scenario
As you will recall from Project One, the police department requested the creation of a Storm and Crime Data Report (SCDR). Detectives have since come back with some new information. They are now investigating the crimes during storms and examining the rising cost of crimes when storms are occurring. This report will provide the detectives with information on the next possible string of crimes. The data you will analyze consists of crimes that occurred in the city of Miami between Jan 1, 2017 and Dec 1, 2019 during storm events. Using the information provided, you will analyze the data and write up a SCDR for the police department detailing each component and providing explanations.
